# Overview
## Random Password Generator 2018

This project is a proof of concept application created during 0x90SHODAN's early days of studying cybersecurity. It generates random bits using quantum superposition, merging quantum mechanics with password security for a fun exploration.

The project consists of Q# source code, a Python encoding script, and a BAT file. It was designed on a Windows workstation.

## The Q# Program
The Q# program implements the quantum algorithm within a simulator such as the Microsoft Quantum Development Toolkit. The program outputs an array of randomly generated bytes, with each byte representing an ASCII character. These bytes are written to `bits.txt` and then encoded into ASCII characters using Python.

## The Python Script
The Python script reads all bytes from `bits.txt`. For each byte, an ASCII character is generated (1 char = 1 byte = 8 bits). Once all bytes are read and appended to an array, the `binaryToAscii(s)` function converts the bytes to a displayable ASCII character.

An additional loop ensures that each ASCII character stays within the range of characters seen on a standard US keyboard. The generated password is then returned in the command line.

## The BAT Script
To simplify execution and wrap the Q# program and Python script together, a BAT script is included. It prompts the user for a password length, and after receiving it, `run.bat` starts executing the Q# program by passing the password length as the first argument.

After the Q# program generates the random list of bytes, it invokes the Python script.

## Requirements
- Python 3: For executing the `Ascii.py` script, no external libraries are required. [Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Microsoft .NET Framework. [Installation Guide](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)
- QDK Package for .NET: Command-line installation using `dotnet new -i Microsoft.Quantum.ProjectTemplates`
